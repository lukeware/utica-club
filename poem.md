#UC 4 ME
##by R. Turner

on new years eve  
we waited for fireworks  
but nothing happened  
and nobody was there   


i didn't care  
i walked away and shrugged  
what i wouldn't give  
for a utica club  


the decade is half over now  
so many things have happened  
i can't keep track of who or how i've changed  
but i know that i have  


back in the old town again  
everybody's dancing with drinks in their hands  
i wasn't in the mood  
so i just stopped and stared  


i didn't care  
i walked away and shrugged  
what i wouldn't give  
to be back in korea singing karaoke  


i didn't care  
i walked away and shrugged  
what i wouldn't give  
to be back with my friends singing karaoke
